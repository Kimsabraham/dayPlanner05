# HW 05 Day Planner

## Description

This Project was to make a day planner using javaScript and Jquery while keeping track of the users time. This project help me try to understand how to keep code dynamic and flexible. The challening part for this project was having the background color change along with the time, while giving every text in a row its local storage.
